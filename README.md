# SmartMeter
The SmartMeter Project allows users to view the electricity, water, natural gas bill price and consumption amount instantly on the website and mobile application. In addition, thanks to the system we have developed, the amount and cost of consumption at the end of the month are calculated based on the amount of expenditure made since the beginning of the month.
In this way, our system encourages the user to save, as the user can predict the invoice price.
